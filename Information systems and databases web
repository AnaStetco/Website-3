    <h3>Information systems and databases</h3 >
	<p> This module is my favorite so far and  I enjoyed the most.I think SQL is a unvaluable skill very important for data science</p>
    <h3> About module</h3>
    <p>Module was very interactive and it made me realise
		I want to persuade a career in data.I think learning SQL was key starting in my future career.Sql is way to interact with databases,so by learning this query language
		,I have understood  how databses work.We have covered a lot of SQL and all the features available such as indexes and query planning,constraint,views and foreign keys.</p>
    <h3> End of module </h3>
    <p>For the end part of module we had to implement a database based on a case study organization to a maximum of ten tables 
		conform fully to the design using Oracle Sql developer, showing we have a comprehensive
		knowledge of SQL.
		
	For the future I would like to learn different versions of SQL like My Sql,Oracle,MsSql maybe in combination with learning SQL on the server side. </p>
