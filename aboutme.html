    <h3>Hello</h3 >
	<p> My name is Ana and I am first year student of  Information and Computing Systems at University of London </p>
    <h3>Why did I choose University of West London ?</h3>
    <p> I came to UWL to get the job of my dreams. I haven't graduated yet but hopefully I will get my dream job before that.Recently I have consider focusing my further educations 
			ambitions on a degree in this field.</p>
    <h3>Few other things about me </h3>
    <p> In my spare time I like to read, and travel to see new places and experience a local customs and cuisin. 
		First time I have used a computer I was about 14.
		I was very intrigued how computers work and I have developed a  curiosity about the theory behind this wonderful machines.
		I was very attracted about computer games and later I have developed a desire about leanring programming as well.
		I wish to find myself being part of the fastest tehnology in the world.
		My main degree is in dentistry and I have focused on this job for many years but than, I have realised this is not the job I want to persude for the rest of my life
		I was brave enough to decide in my early 30`s that I need a career change where I can actually follow my true call.
		I like to meet new people from different backgrounds 
		and learn about their culture.Living close to Londont wich is multicultural city allows me to experience this things which I truly enkoy.	</p>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>Combining work with a degree isn`t easy but University Of West London has giving me this opportunity to be able to do this two things at same time offering part time 
		intenisve  weekend courses,my main aim career is to work in the IT industry.	</p>
