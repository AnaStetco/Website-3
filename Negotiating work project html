    <h3>Negotiating work </h3 >
	<p> This module has taught me how to think more in depth about reflecting writing.I have always known I need to improve my academic writing and this subject has helped 
		me learn how to do this.This has also helped me to gain new skills in my actual job and also colaborate with my manager for learning how to create a web form using html,
		css and php languages.
		</p>
    <h3> About module</h3>
    <p> I found this module very intresting as it helped me define what my aims are,smart goals and also manage well any potential risks I might have had to ecounter
		while doing my project.</p>
    <h3>End of Module </h3>
    <p>For learning how to create the Web Form I have had to learn first Html,Css and than Php for giving the form functionality as this is native to the web.A php is relatively
		use to make html more dynamic.
		The project for this module has helped to plan my learning methods more efficiently being able to learn this three languages quick and efficient.</p>
