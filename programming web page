    <h3>Programming</h3 >
	<p> Java was our first module of learning how to code.I found it to be a intresting language and one of the most popular programming languages in the world today.</p>
    <h3> About module</h3>
    <p> This module has not only tought me how to code but also helped me how to think.I think the module had a very good planning structure and also tecaher made 
		the classes very interactive.
	 Learning Java I have understood differences between high level language and low level language and also 
		I have realised its easier to learn high level language than low level languages as are less error prone ,while  learning low languages is more complex and this requires a better
		understanding of the computer arhitecture.
		I thought it was particularly intresting how high level languages are an easier to understand and is user friendly compare to low level
		languages which are more approapriate for developing new operating systems. </p>
    <h3>End of Module</h3>
    <p>	At the end of the module I was able to implement  a small functional software application in Eclipse Ide Platform called Recipes where I have demonstrated 
		core options for Add,Print,Quit and Count. 	</p>
